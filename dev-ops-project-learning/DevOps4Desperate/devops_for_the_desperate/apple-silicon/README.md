# Apple Silicon

> __Please note, these instructions are a work in progress and may not work on your host.__

If you are using an Apple Silicon computer as your host machine, VirtualBox is not an option. Apple Siliconâ€™s CPU is based off the ARM architecture, and VirtualBox only works on x86.

Instead, you'll need to use a virtualization technology like Parallels (https://parallels.com), VMware Fusion (https://vmware.com), or QEMU (https://www.qemu.org) to create an ARM-based virtual machine.

The first two options are paid software and may provide a better user experience. The last option, QEMU, is open source and will require some extra configuration.

Please use the `vagrant/` directory and `minikube/` directory if you are using Parallels (or VMWare Fusion).

If you opt for QEMU, then follow the instructions in the README inside the `qemu/` directory.
