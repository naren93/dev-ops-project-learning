Developers from Hiroku came up with these 12 factors to keep in mind when building an app -
1. Codabase
  Have a single code base for your application. Git helps all devs on the same product at the same time on a central hub. [Github, Gitlab, BitBucket] MULTIPLE APPS SHARING THE SAME CODE IS WRONG.
2. Dependencies
  Explicitly declare and isolate the dependency. Ex. package.json, requirements.txt. Create isolated environment for each app with its own dependencies. Ex. Virtual python environment venv, docker containers.
3. Configuration
  .env file that automatically fetches env variables as per dev, test, stage, prod environments. Thus saving info from public eyes.
4. Backing Services
  You should point your app to another instance and it should just work.
5. Build, release, run
  Roll back the previous commit - 
6. Processes
  Updating one process that is running - but if multiple process is running then we might get wrong user session information - dont store anything in process but in the backend service - it does not matter which process it points to - thus point the user session to a redis db to ensure process is not corrupted or intrupted.
7. Port Bindings
8. Concurrency
  What happens when we have more users visiting our sites? Horizontal scaling and load balancing - create app as independent stateless app.
9. Disposibility
10. Dev/Prod Parity
11. Logs
12. Admin Processes
